# SpringBoot-Projects
"I am currently learning Spring Boot by building real-world projects. My focus is on understanding how to create RESTful APIs, connect with databases, handle CRUD operations, and manage backend logic using Spring Boot. Each project helps me strengthen my skills in Java, Spring Framework, and modern backend development practices."
